# ðŸŽ¬ MovieBin

## Project Description

**MovieBin** is a personal movie tracker built with Flask, Tailwind CSS, and SQLAlchemy. It allows users to log in, add movies theyâ€™ve watched, track their personal ratings, and store the date they watched them â€” all in a clean, organized interface.

### MovieBin allows users to:
- Create a new account and log in securely  
- Add movies with details like title, genre, release year, and director  
- Track each movieâ€™s personal rating and watched date  
- View all movies in a personal movie log  
- Edit or delete movie entries anytime  

### This project uses:
- **Flask** for the backend routing and form handling  
- **Flask-Login** for authentication  
- **Flask-WTF** for form management  
- **SQLAlchemy** for database models and queries  
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
